Testing and co-designing our [tempeh moulds](tempeh-moulds.html) with the help of Valentina from [MyVeganFam](https://www.myveganfam.com/) in the framework of [Makers'exchange](https://makersxchange.eu/) (an EU project that aims to define and test policies and actions supporting mobility and exchange of experiences between cultural and creative industries).

Designing the next version of our incubator, taking into account the feedback received since our previous prototype. In short: a modular system for the electronics, an integrated screen and a parametric size for the cabinet. Fabricating this new prototype at [Fab Lab Barcelona](https://fablabbcn.org/) as part of [Food Shift](https://foodshift2030.eu/)'s Food Tech 3.0 programme.


Have fun and delicious condiments with quick fermentation. Small dishes that only take a few days to ferment. More on this part soon as we would like to run workshops on this. 

Last but not least: Swimming as much as we can, contemplating the sea bed. Summertime in Spain.
