We are designing the next version of our incubator, taking into account the feedback received since our previous prototype. In short: a modular system for the electronics, an integrated screen and a parametric size for the cabinet.

We will be fabricating the new prototype this summer at [Fab Lab Barcelona](https://fablabbcn.org/) as part of [Food Shift](https://foodshift2030.eu/)'s Food Tech 3.0 programme.

Last month we moved to a new space, located in Poble Nou, Barcelona, Spain. We are in the process of setting up our local environment to accommodate people and workshops.

Last but not least, we are defining our business model and development plan to make this *Domingo Club* a reality in the long term.
