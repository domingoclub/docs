title: Distributed Design and Decentralized Fabrication
---

In the kitchen, it seems natural to share a good recipe and tips and tricks on how to please our taste buds. We share knowledge from one generation to the next. We preserve the cultural heritage while allowing it to be augmented by the findings of the community.

Sharing, collaboration, cooperation and re-appropriation are keys to the success of our project in order to move towards a sustainable society where we understand what we eat, what we do, what we use in our daily lives, a society where we observe and question what we usually take for granted.

We therefore use the principles of distributed design and decentralized manufacturing for the tools we make. Which means that you can download our models, review and adapt them, and produce them yourself.
