# What is it?

Yes, you will have to beat the cucumber. Because beating the cucumber into pieces gives you nice jagged shapes and also crushes the cell structure so the vegetable releases moisture more quickly.

# What you need to make it?

## Ingredients

### Main

- 2 cucumbers
- seasalt (2% of the vegetable weight)

## Smash the cucumber

- Remove the stem of the cucumber
- Put some salt in the palm of your hand and rub the cucumber vigorously with the salt. The skin becomes porous and the cucumber immediately begins to ooze moisture
- Place the cucumber on a cutting board and compassionately beat it into irregular pieces with the rolling pin
- Break the flesh into small pieces with your hands

![It is better to slightly add pressure on the lid before letting it ferment for maximum efficiency](smashed-cucumber-11.jpg)

!!! notes "What's the press lid for?"
    The pressure on salty food accelerates the chemical and physical transformation process of vegetables. What this does is collapse the cell walls of the vegetable, releasing the moisture and concentrating the flavor. So adding some pressure to the veggies helps the salt do its work.
