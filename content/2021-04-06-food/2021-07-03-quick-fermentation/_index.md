Let us introduce you to quick fermentation!

You probably heard about fermentation as processes that can take weeks, months or even years, but some can also be very quick. From a few minutes to several hours.
Even during the early stage of the fermentation process, beneficial bacteria and enzymes are created (for the good of our digestive and immune system!). The end result is a change in taste, texture and nutritional value.

In Japanese culture, these quick-fermented products are used to create small side dishes. They are eaten as a small snack in between courses because they offer a totally different flavour and texture to the rest of the meal. It cleans the pallet, neutralises tastes and offers a refreshing counter balance to heavy or fatty dishes. We also like them in a sandwich or on a toast, or just with a bowl of rice.

Due to its quick process, you won't get the tang of a sour pickle. It can therefore be a starting point for the most sensitive among you.
