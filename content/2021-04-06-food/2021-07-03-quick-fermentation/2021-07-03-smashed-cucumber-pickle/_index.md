# What is it?

Let us introduce you to quick fermentation!
Because fermentation could also be quick and fun, here is a recipe for a smashed cucumber pickle.

Beating the cucumber into pieces gives you nice jagged shapes and also crushes the cell structure so the vegetable releases moisture more quickly.

# What you need to make it?

## Ingredients

- 3cm of ginger
- 1 dried chilipeper
- 1/2 tablespoon of toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon of soja sauce (shoyu)
- 1/2 tablespoon of (rice) vinegar
- 1 teaspoon of sugar
- 1 cucumber
- seasalt (2% of the vegetable weight)

## Material

- a rolling pin
- a container and a press lid


# How to make it?

## Marinade

Grate the ginger and finely chop the chilli.
In a small saucepan, bring the sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and chilli to the boil.
Let cool to room temperature.

## Smash the cucumber

Cut off the ends of the cucumber.
Perform the ita zuri technique: Put some salt in the palm of your hand and rub the cucumber vigorously with the salt. The skin becomes porous and the cucumber immediately begins to ooze moisture. Place the cucumber on a cutting board and compassionately crush it into irregular pieces with the rolling pin. Break the flesh into small pieces again with your hands.

## Pickle-press

Put the cucumber pieces in your container and mix them with your hands with the remaining sea salt and the marinade. Put the press lid on top, push it lightly, and let pickle at room temperature for 1 hours.

# Storage

Keep it in the fridge for up to 2-3 days.
