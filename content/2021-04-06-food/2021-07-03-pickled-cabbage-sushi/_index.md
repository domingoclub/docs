# What is it?


# What you need to make it?

## Ingredients

- dried shiitaké
- sesame seeds
- 6 large Chinese cabbage leaves
- 1-2 carrots
- 1 stalk of celery
- 3cm of ginger root
- 1 (dried) chilipeper
- 1 tablespoon of toasted sesame oil
- 1 spring onion
- 1 teaspoon of sugar (Barley Malt Syrup)
- 2 tablespoon of soja sauce (shoyu)
- 1 teaspoon of seasalt
- 3 tablespoon of vinegar

## Material

- a sushi mat
- a container and a press lid

# How to make it?

## Preparation

Soak the shiitaké in warm water.
Roast the sesame seeds in a pan until they smell good.

## Cabbage Leaves

Cut off the bottom of the cabbage and carefully pick out 6 beautiful leaves.
Dip the leaves in a large amount of boiling salted water or steam them until they are soft enough to be rolled up. As soon as they are, cool them immediately in iced cold water.

Drain the leaves in a strainer and dry them with a clean towel. Cut off the ribbed part of each cabbage leaf, so that you have a flat surface.

## Filling

Cut the shiitake, carrots and celery into fine julienne strips.
Finely chop the ginger and chilli.
Mix it all together.

## Sushi making

Lay two cabbage leaves lengthwise in different directions on the sushi mat.
Spread 1/3 of the filling slightly below the middle across the width of the mat.
Do not use too much stuffing, otherwise the cabbage leaf will tear.
Roll everything tightly in the mat, as if making sushi.
Hold the rolled mat with its contents upright and squeeze out as much moisture as possible with both hands.
Carefully remove the cabbage roll from the mat and cut it into 2.5 cm high pieces.

Repeat for the other two rolls.

## Marinade

Finely chop the spring onions.
Heat the sesame oil in a pan and fry the spring onions.
Add the sugar, soy sauce, salt and vinegar and stir well.

## Pickle-press

Place the cabbage rolls upright against each other in your container and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Pour the hot marinade over the cabbage rolls and put the press lid on top, push it lightly, and let pickle at room temperature for 3 hours.
