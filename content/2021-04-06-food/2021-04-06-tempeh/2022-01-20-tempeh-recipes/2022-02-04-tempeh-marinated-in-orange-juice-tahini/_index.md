## Ingredients

For 2-3 people

### Tempeh & marinade :

- 100gr of bean tempeh (which is equivalent to our round tempeh)
- 3 tablespoon of  tahini
- the juice of 1 orange
- the zest of 1 orange
- 1 teaspoon of ras-el-hanout
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 inch of ginger, minced
- Salt, to taste

### Accompaniment & topping :

- 1 cup of rice
- 1 big leek
- 1 big parsnip
- the juice of half a lemon
- 1 big clove of garlic
- a piece of raw beetroot and/or raw black radish to grate


## Method

1. Prepare the marinade the day before. Combine the tahini, orange juice, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, minced garlic and ginger, ras-el-hanout and some salt. Whisk until combined. Taste and adjust seasoning per your taste.
2. Still the day before, cut the tempeh into pieces. We cut our into triangles this time. Soak the tempeh in the marinade and put it in the fridge overnight, or at least for 8 hours.
3. The next day, cook your rice and set aside.
4. Melt your leeks in a pan over low heat with the parsnips. Add the lemon juice and the minced garlic last. Salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
5. Remove the tempeh from the marinade. It may have solidified a bit, which is normal. You can remove some of the marinade that sticks to the tempeh if you wish. Sear both sides until golden and set aside. Reserve the rest of the marinade.
7. Add about 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to the remaining marinade and whisk until smooth.
8. Arrange everything in a plate. Add the remaining marinade and some grated beetroot/radish on top.
9. Enjoy!
