title: Talk at FAB16 "Fabricating the commons"
---

This morning we had the chance to present our open-source incubator at the [Fab16](https://fab16.org/), the worldwide event of the Fablab network! We gave a talk, or theory workshop as they call it, for the first time and we really enjoyed doing it.

We covered topics such as:

- fermentation as a process of partnering with microorganisms
- plant-based proteins as an effective solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
- how to make tempeh
- why we make open source tools
- how to leverage the principles of distributed design and decentralised manufacturing

Thank you all for coming and we hope to share the recording soon for those interested who missed it :-)
