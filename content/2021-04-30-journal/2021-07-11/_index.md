title: Bingo Escabelle

We have sent a prototype version of our [Incubator Necklace](https://domingoclub.com/incubator-necklace.html) to [See U Brussels](https://www.see-u.brussels/) in the context of their Bingo Escabelle that took place this Sunday 11th of July.

This incubator necklace is a playful invitation to observe and understand the collaboration with natural processes. The glass petri dish contains fungus spores and those spores need constant humidity and temperature to develop. So if you wear the necklace for 3 weeks in a row, the roots of the mushrooms will grow and when the necklace has turned white, mini edible mushrooms will grow in the bright spot where you will have left the necklace.

Bingo Escabelle put the spotlight on engaged Brussels projects and collectives by presenting their creative work during a fun and convivial moment.

We are looking forward to discover who the new owner of this micro pet is!
