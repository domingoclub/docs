title: "Weâ€™d like to share fabrication recipes like we share food recipes"
---

This summer, [makery.info](https://www.makery.info/en/) (media for labs) came to interview us in our studio in Barcelona about our practice and projects. The transcript is now online on [their website](https://www.makery.info/en/2021/09/11/english-domingo-club-wed-like-to-share-fabrication-recipes-like-we-share-food-recipes/). Check it out to better understand what we do :-)

Thanks Maya & Ewen, come back anytime for more "fermented discussions" ðŸŒ»
