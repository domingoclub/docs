This morning I came back from the local fruit and vegetable shop with a ton of chillies, with the idea of making a new [[sriracha]] sauce (a fermented chilli sauce from Thailand). This sauce never lasts long in our house, we eat it with just about everything.

The recipe is composed of two steps with a fermentation time in between, which makes it quite quick and easy to make for an excellent and very spicy result.
