title: Food System Game Changer
---

EAT, IDEO, Thought For Food, The Rockefeller Foundation and Forum For the Future have joined forces to discover and support ideas, enterprises and initiatives that have the potential to transform our world’s food systems. The Food Systems Game Changers Lab is in support of the UN Food Systems Summit.

With the Domingo Club, we’re working with other game changers who have ideas, initiatives, and innovations that can bring positive change to global food systems—and the passion, grit, collaborative spirit, and determination required to take our solutions forward in partnership with others.

We're part of the innovating protein cohort.
