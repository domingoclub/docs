title: The new version of the incubator is coming
---

We have started the design of the new version of our incubator, taking into account the feedback received since our previous prototype. In particular, its size!

Everyone has different needs, tastes, space, and so does our incubator. We design our new model/prototype in a free and open-source software, [Freecad](https://www.freecadweb.org/), that offers everyone the possibility to use and modify our designs to meet their needs.

We will be fabricating the new incubator this summer at [Fab Lab Barcelona](https://fablabbcn.org/) as part of [Food Shift](https://foodshift2030.eu/)'s Food Tech 3.0 programme. All the sources of our project will be available as soon as they are usable, on our website and most probably on [Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/) ;-)
