Good news! We won the Distributed Design Award 2021!

Our project was first selected, among the 12 finalists, in the *Adaptable and open-design* category and now, after a few weeks of suspense, we have just learned that we won the award for excellence! Woop woop!

We'll receive 2000â‚¬ to finance the development of the Domingo Club and our incubator. Long live the Domingo Club!
