!!! notes "Work in progress"
    These moulds are currently being designed, fabricated and tested. What you see here is relatively temporary and subject to change. This is still experimental.

Documentation page for the fabrication of our silicone tempeh moulds. These silicone moulds are supposed to be an improved version of our [3D printed moulds](3D-printed-moulds.html). They use the same model but are first moulded in a block of wax and then cast in food grade silicone. This would allow us to increase our production speed while guaranteeing high quality.
