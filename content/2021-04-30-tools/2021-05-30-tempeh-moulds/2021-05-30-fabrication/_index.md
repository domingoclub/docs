title: How to 3D-print your own tempeh moulds
---

# Distributed Design and Decentralised Fabrication

We want our tempeh moulds open-source and easy to anyone to replicate and we allow peer reviews to make sure everyone agrees on how things are done.

We therefore use the principles of distributed design and decentralised manufacturing for the tools we make. Which means that you can download our models, review and adapt them, and produce them yourself.

# The Fabrication of our moulds

Our moulds are 3D printed with our [Prusa Mini](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-mini/) with PETG filament from [Prusament](https://shop.prusa3d.com/fr/prusament/1300-prusament-petg-pistachio-green-1kg.html)

We use PETG filament because the material is food grade but we realised that printing this material in 3D does not guarantee a food grade object because the hollows between the printing layers become a nest of bacteria that is difficult to clean.

Either a top coat would therefore be necessary or just ensure that the part is thoroughly cleaned, sanitised and verified clean prior to use. Before using our moulds, we first wash them with dish soap and dry them with a towel, then disinfect them with 70% alcohol and a cotton cloth.

# Instructions to do it yourself

## Material:

- PETG or PLA filaments should be food safe.
- Beware, potentially safe filaments might contain unsafe pigments, check it twice with your supplier.
- You should make the surface as smooth as possible. Unfortunately, this cannot be done properly with chemical smoothing.
- So 3D print the moulds at the lowest feasible layer height, we recommend 0,10 mm of layer height with an infill of 100%.

## 3D printer:

- Use a stainless steel nozzle.
- Keep your printer and printing environment as clean as possible.
- If, like us, you have a PTFE tube in the extruder, the temperatures do not exceed 240Â°C.
