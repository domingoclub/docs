# The Design

The design is pretty simple, but smooth and balanced. It consists of a ~120x80x30 mm container (3mm of thickness) with a lid. There are small perforations all around the container and on the lid to allow the tempeh to breath during the fermentation process. The lid has notches to hold two rubber bands to keep the soybeans compacted inside. And the bottom part of container has a removable coin to easily remove the tempeh from the mould after incubation.

With these constraints put together, several forms can follow. We have for now, a rectangle, a zigzag and a stackable round mould.

We use [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/), an open-source parametric 3D modeler that you can download for free, to design our mould. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify our design by going back into our spreadsheet and change the values in milimeters.
