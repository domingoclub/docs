At Domingo Club, we make fermented food, open-source tools and explore collaboration with natural processes to promote understanding, transparency, resilience and equity in our global food system.

We're developing an open-source fermentor that can be easily fabricated anywhere to promote fermented plant-based protein (tempeh) everywhere. An fermentor is a device that maintains the necessary parameters, such as temperature and humidity, for an environment suitable for the growth of mycelium (the vegetative part of fungi) and microorganisms of all kinds.
