title: Fermentor v0.3 Notes
---

Notes on the current build of the Fermenter, ideas and improvements for the next version, what we like and what we dislike.

# Next version

It is hard to finish one version without starting to think about the next.

## Fabrication

We would like to simplify the fabrication process of the fermenter and therefore its design. By reducing the number of machines and materials needed to make it. We would like to explore a laser-cut model only so that it is easier for everyone to make their own.

## Finishing

Adding colours! We would like to add a protective, coloured finish to the wooden board. This will give the Domingo touch but more importantly protect it from moisture and bacteria colonies.
